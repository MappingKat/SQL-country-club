# Country Club Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project explores and analyzes data from the "country_club" database, which contains information about a country club's facilities, members, and bookings. The project leverages SQL queries to uncover insights and patterns within the data, addressing various aspects of the club's operations.

## Database Structure

Bookings: Records of facility bookings, including booking ID, facility ID, member ID, start time, and number of slots booked.
Facilities: Details about club facilities, including facility ID, monthly maintenance cost, name, member cost, guest cost, and initial outlay.
Members: Information about club members, including member ID, surname, first name, address, zip code, join date, telephone number, and recommended by (optional).
## Key Queries

Identifying facilities with member fees: Q1
Finding facilities with fees less than 20% of maintenance: Q3
Retrieving details for specific facilities: Q4
Finding latest members: Q5
Listing members who've used tennis courts: Q6
Listing bookings costing over $30 on a specific date: Q8 and Q9
Counting facilities without member fees: Q10
Categorizing facilities by maintenance cost: Q11
